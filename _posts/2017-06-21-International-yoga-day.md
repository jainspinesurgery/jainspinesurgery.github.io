Here comes the International  **Yoga** day. So, what you all know about **Yoga** ?? Let's understand the basic definition as below:

**Yoga** is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of **Yoga** practices like hatha **Yoga** etc..Some **Yoga** teachers defined single line difference between **Yoga** and general excercise as **Yoga** to be practised slowly and gently whereas general excercise to be practiced quickly and with force.

 I at **Physioknow** recommend daily **Yoga** excercises to keep calm mind and healthy physique.There are lot of general physiotherapy excercises which are similar to **Yoga** asnas, whereas in case of extreme pain and accidental related problems, I also provide excercises through different physio machines.

I am sure all **Physioknow** followers had enjoyed International **Yoga** day today and contributed their atleast 15-20 minutes of time by practicing different **Yoga** asnas.

I pray for all of you to have healthy and peaceful routine which is also full of knowledge towards healthy life.

**I end today with below Quote:**

*"Simple smile every morning after you wake up and before you sleep, already gained you one extra healthy day for life"*

**Be healthy, Be happy !! and keep adding knowledge in your life**
