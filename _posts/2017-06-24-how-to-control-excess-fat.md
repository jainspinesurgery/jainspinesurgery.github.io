***Oh god!! i become so fat***. 

I will stop eating all fatty things from tomorrow, actually i will stop eating any food itself from tomorrow; will only have saldas, fruits, glass of milk etc. etc. etc....Have you came across such thoughts anytime or someday. I beleive yes atleast once in our lifetime we suffer from such hallucinations; some people come across such thoughts only once in a while, whereas some people see such nightmares quite frequently.

**How many of us thought of doing some excercise also for reducing fat??** Quite few i beleive, yes it's true, only very few out of all who think of reducing fat, think for excercise as remedy to get rid of it. May be because of lazinness !!

Interestingly if you ask any professional dieticians or experts, nobody will recommend to stop eating to reduce fat, actually they recommend you to have better balanced diet to keep fat under control. Fat is a part of our body and it is definately require for some or other process to fucntion our body organs, but as excess of anything is bad, same is the case with fat also.

**So what is the magic with which we can reduce excess fat without stop eating??**Yes it is excercise with which we can control fat as much as it is require, but which one to choose out of so many excercise practices? Is it - Yoga, swimming,gym,jogging/running or soemthing else? You can choose anyone or may be combination of all.

In **Physioknow** we understand that lot of physical conditions and diseases occurs due to excess fat which inoccur excess body weight, thus we recommend different excercises to control fat, along with balanced diet. Knee pain is very common among patients we saw having excess weight. Other conditions like low stamina which further weakens body muscle, also cause pain in different joints. Just by controlling excess fat you can live long and healthy.

Apart with other daily excersises the best i recommend is **running/jogging** regularly atleast 2 KM in open field (as it will also give you some fresh air which you will definately not get on treadmills).

**Eat healthy, jog healthy ,live healthy**

***Happy Running !!***
